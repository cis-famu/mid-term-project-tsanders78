# Mid-Term Project (SOAP Web Service)

For your mid-term project, you will need to develop a SOAP web service of your choice. The web service can be for any type of system of your choosing, as long as it does not reuse any of the ideas done in assignments and in-class activities.

Imagine you have been contracted by a business owner to create a web service of their company. You will need to create the following:
1. **(10 points)** A Firebase Database. *Remember to include your credentials file*.
1. **(50 points)** A SOAP-based web service with:
	- Commented code in ordered structure (separate models from services, etc.)
	- A minimum of 5 endpoints. Each endpoint must be able to: 
		- create a new record
		- retrieve all records
		- retrieve 1 record using an identifier
		- retrieve one or more record(s) using some other field
1. **(40 points)** Document the web service and their endpoints. Documentation includes:
	- Description of the overall system
	- Data dictionary for the database 
	- List of all available endpoints
		- Data required to be passed and format
		- Data returned from the endpoint
	- WSDL for each endpoint
	-Sample calls to each endpoint and the corresponding response
 
*Documentation should be either a Markdown file or PDF submitted via the repository* 
 
***Bonus (up to 10 points)***

Add a 5th function to each endpoint to be able to update a record.
